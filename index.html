            <p>I have recently completed a BSc Physics degree at the University of Bristol. Since leaving my fulltime role as a vehicle mechanic in the Army in 2017, alonside my studies, I have worked as a HGV driver, an auto fitter at Halfords and as part of the site maintenance team at Gloverspiece Minifarm and school. My primary interests are in 3D printing, computing and escape rooms.</p>

                  <h4>Dye Sensitized Solar Cells</h4>
                  <h5>Final Year Project</h5>
                  <p>For my final year project at university I fabricated and tested the efficiency of Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) based on Natural Dyes. This involved characterising the efficiency of a silicon solar cell in a simulated solar rig before fabricating and testing the completed cells. The project largely revolved around experimenting with dyes extracted from berries and leaves and combining them to take advantage of their improved light absorbance at different wavelengths.</p>

                  <p>Upon finishing school, I joined the Army and after six months of basic training and one year of trade training, I began working at 7 Transport Regiment as a vehicle mechanic. My main role in the workshop was completing vehicle maintenance and repairs on Land Rovers and MAN trucks. When I started this role, I was working under a more experienced mechanic as an apprentice, but as my knowledge and skills grew, I began to work more independently until eventually taking on apprentices of my own and becoming a mentor to newly qualified mechanics.</p>

                  <p>After leaving the regular army to go back into education I transfered to the army reserves. I became a class 1 vehicle mechanic and was promoted to lance corporal. I also achieved professional recognition as an engineering technician within the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. </p>

                    <h4>3D Printing and Laser Engraving</h4>
                    <p>At the start of 2021 I purchased my first 3D printer, a Creality ender 3. As with most people who start this hobby I soon found myself endlessly upgrading the printer with printed parts and designing my own model for home improvements. 3D printing is challenging but highly rewarding. It’s often difficult to get things working correctly as the printers are still far from the point of plug and play. This challenge makes it all the more rewarding when going from modelling my own 3D designs from scratch to actually making them a reality I can hold in my hand.</p>
                    <p>I have now purchased a laser module which has been wired into my printer to enable me to use the same system for laser engraving.</p>

                    <h4>Web design</h4>
                    <p>During my summer after completing my second year at university I decided to upgrade my partners Etsy shop to a full personal website. With no knowledge of websites I set up an account with Wix and began building her an ecommerce website. A custom domain name was purchased and setup separately, although the website is still under development at this time.</p>
                    <p>After learning a lot about website creation for my partners ecommerce site I decided to find out how I could make my own website in HTML with free hosting. I downloaded a free HTML template, purchased a domain name and set up the hosting through a GitHub page. Using transferable knowledge from python and markdown and a few quick youtube tutorials, I was able to transform the template into athorton.co.uk. This website was created and is managed using visual studio code.</p>

                    <h4>Escape Rooms</h4>
                    <p>My partner and I enjoy attempting escape rooms and together have tried to escape from over 50 different rooms, including two in Greece and one in Spain. There are very few rooms we have failed to escape from and I embrace any opportunity to test my knowledge and problem-solving ability. </p>
