                  <p>I worked at Halfords as an auto fitter during my summer break from university. My role varied from fitting batteries and bulbs to customers vehicles, to serving customers at the main checkout. My previous experience working with cars as a mechanic allowed me to pick up this role very quickly which resulted in opportunities for quick progression within the company. This job gave me valuable experience in retail and customer service.  </p>

                  <p>While studying at college I worked at a minifarm and school as part of the site team. My role was to complete general maintenance on the site and on the farm’s machinery. This would include fixing and putting up fences, repairing and building animal enclosures and servicing the tractors and other machinery as required. These tasks would often be completed on my own with little or no supervision, with the exception of larger tasks which would require me to work with others in a team.</p>

                  <p>Upon finishing school, I joined the Army and after six months of basic training and one year of trade training, I began working at 7 Transport Regiment as a vehicle mechanic. My main role in the workshop was completing vehicle maintenance and repairs on Land Rovers and MAN trucks. When I started this role, I was working under a more experienced mechanic as an apprentice, but as my knowledge and skills grew, I began to work more independently until eventually taking on apprentices of my own and becoming a mentor to newly qualified mechanics.</p>

                    <p>While in the Army, I completed over 900 skydives including over 30 parachute displays, mostly into large high profile events such as the Bournemouth air festival, Torbay air show and into Canterbury cricket ground. While working for the Joint Services Parachute centre I became competent in freeflying and wingsuiting before becoming qualified as a formation skydiving coach. </p>
                    <p>Each year I competed at the national formation skydiving championships, the armed forces parachute championships and the national wingsuit championships achieving a large collection of bronze silver and gold medals over the years. </p>
                    <p>After leaving the army I qualified as a tandem skydiving instructor (Now expired) making me responsible for a group of students before their jump and the safety of the student that I complete the skydive with.</p>

                    <h4>3D Printing and Laser Engraving</h4>
                    <p>At the start of 2021 I purchased my first 3D printer, a Creality ender 3. As with most people who start this hobby I soon found myself endlessly upgrading the printer with printed parts and designing my own model for home improvements. 3D printing is challenging but highly rewarding. It’s often difficult to get things working correctly as the printers are still far from the point of plug and play. This challenge makes it all the more rewarding when going from modelling my own 3D designs from scratch to actually making them a reality I can hold in my hand.</p>
                    <p>I have now purchased a laser module which has been wired into my printer to enable me to use the same system for laser engraving.</p>

                    <h4>Web design</h4>
                    <p>During my summer after completing my second year at university I decided to upgrade my partners etsy shop to a full personal website. With no knowledge of websites I set up an account with Wix and began building her an ecommerce website. A custom domain name was purchased and setup separately and the full live website can now be viewed at <a href="https://www.thingsbyphoebe.co.uk">ThingsByPhoebe.co.uk.</a></p>
                    <p>After learning a lot about website creation for my partners ecommerce site I decided to find out how I could make my own website in HTML with free hosting. I downloaded a free HTML template, purchased a domain name and set up the hosting through a GitHub page. Using transferable knowledge from python and markdown and a few quick youtube tutorials I was able to transform the template into Ash-Horton.co.uk.</p>
